The authors dispens with recurrence and show how *self-attention*, can be used as the *heart* of the model.\n\nThe paper written in 2017 had a significant impact on NLP and deep learning and paved the way for later breakthroughs such as BERT or GPT-3. The model of 2017 is sometimes refered to as the *original transformer*. \n\n<img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DCYHlQCUMAAsLhG?format=jpg&name=small\" style=\"width:512px;height:384px;\" alt=\"Dwight's Attention\">\n\n## About this Notebook 👨‍💻\nThe transformer is trained to translate sentences from French to English . I use a rather small dataset with English-French sentence pairs (e.g. \"I don't know\", \"Je ne sais pas\").\n\nThe goal was to make a simple end to end example and to undestand the attention-mechanism as well as the model architechture of the first transformer. For a long time the model did not learn as expected. Despite the loss getting smaller every epoch and \"semi-sain\"inference, the model would never converge 🧐 . I could finally fix it by borrowing the code for the sublayers from [the annotated transformer](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/annotated-transformer/#embeddings-and-softmax). Another good source is Peter Bloem's [blog post](https://peterbloem.nl/blog/transformers). \n\nSince the original paper is really well written, I mostly quote from it directly to explain what's happening.

Usually when we feed our input vectors into to a linear layer the vectors do not *see each other*. There is no interaction. Well, with attention, they DO *see each other*. Look at the formula bellow. The dot product of the keys and values is some sort of interbreeding. ❤️ (Key and values are linear projections of the same vectors.) Through the dot product with the values, the most intersting interactions are then selected. So, we get context-enriched, interaction heavy feature vectors as ouput. So that no illegal interactions happen (appart from the incest), a mask is applied to prevent interactions with \"the future\".

We also modify the self-attention\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\n\n\nThe first application of the attention in the decoder (sublayer1) is described as follows:\n> Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n\nThe second application of the attention in the decoder (sublayer2) is described as follows:\n> In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence.

Of course for better results more training and more data would do the trick.\n\nThis was the first time I implemented a high quality deep-learning paper. I learned that this model is \"sensitive\", meaning that small errors in the implementation will make the model very *unreasonable*. 🤪 It took some patience, but, in order to understand the topic there is no better way. Hopefully, this is helpful to somebody out there... 😊  ","metadata":{}}]}
